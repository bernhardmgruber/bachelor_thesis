\subsection{About RISC Software GmbH}

The RISC Software GmbH is a limited liability company and part of the software park Hagenberg located in Upper Austria. It has been founded in 1992 by Univ.-Prof. Dr. phil. Dr. h.c.mult. Bruno Buchberger as part of RISC, which was founded five years before and stands for Research Institute for Symbolic Computation. While the institute performs basic research between the fields of mathematics and computer science, the RISC Software GmbH dedicates itself to the application of mathematical and computational research. Beside a small set of software products, the RISC Software GmbH's main focus lies on providing customized software solutions using state-of-the-art and even cutting-edge technologies.

The company is divided into four departments (called units) designating its primary competences:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Logistic informatics
	\item Applied scientific computing
	\item Medical informatics
	\item Advanced computing technologies
\end{itemize}

The company operates profit-orientated with a non-profit character as, according to the company agreement, all profits will be reinvested into research and development \cite{risc_website}.

The internship was conducted from April to June in 2013 working on the project Regio 13 Enlight as part of the unit applied scientific computing under supervision of DI (FH) Alexander Leutgeb.
