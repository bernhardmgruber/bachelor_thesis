\section*{Acknowledgments}

I want to thank my professor Herwig Mayr for putting in a good work for me at the RISC software company GmbH. On the technical site, I also want to thank my supervisor at RISC, Alexander Leutgeb, for the excellent support on all subjects of the project. Personally, also a thank you for several interesting discussions we have held after work. Furthermore, I want to give thanks to the RISC company itself, for providing me with high quality equipment and an amazing work station during my three month internship which made working a pleasure. Finally, also a thumb-up to Michael Hava for having the most in-depth C++ knowledge of a human being I have ever met. I learned a great deal by reading your code.
