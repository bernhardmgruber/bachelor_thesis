\section*{Abstract}

This thesis provides a quick introduction into programming for GPUs using OpenCL. It then continues with several implementations of standard algorithms for the GPU to solve problems like sorting arrays or multiplying matrices. Each GPU implementation is compared and benchmarked with one or more traditional CPU approaches. As GPUs and CPUs feature different hardware architectures appropriate algorithms have been chosen to exploit the underlying platform at best.
