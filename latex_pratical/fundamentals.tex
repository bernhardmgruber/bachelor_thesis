\section{Fundamentals}

\subsection{Raycasting}

vs. raytracing
vs. conventional rendering

principle

image with camera and image plane

advantages/disadvantages of rendering with ray casting

\subsubsection{Acceleration structures}

why do we need acceleration structures?

kd trees
bounding volume hierarchy
BSP

regular grid

traversing

\subsubsection{Packet casting}

different traversing

frustum culling
cache coherence (of adjacent rays)
SIMD


\subsection{Boolean raycasting}

works equal to CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry), except resulting mesh is never explicitly generated

water-tight

\subsection{OpenCL}

GPU hw architecture, how do kernels work? NDRange, buffers
