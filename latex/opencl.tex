\section{OpenCL}



\subsection{What is OpenCL?}
open industry standard
Khronos
Vendors
Components (API, OpenCL C Language, Compiler, ...)

\subsection{Areas of application}
OpenCL
GPGPU computing
WebCL

\subsection{Requirements}
GPU and CPU Hardware
Drivers
SDK (Header and Libraries)
Bindings for other programming languages

\subsection{Hardware architectures}

GPU /CPU hardware
similarities/differences

\subsection{Hardware abstraction}
platforms, devices, command queues, programs, kernels, buffers, ...

\subsection{Memory model}

\subsubsection{Types of memory}
different types of memory on the GPU
global local constant private
texture, pinned memory
performance
how do we access them?

\subsubsection{General design considerations}
coalesced memory access
local memory as programmable cache (and method of sync)
bench conflicts

\subsubsection{Data transfer}
read, write buffers
sync, async

\subsection{Kernel execution}
what is a kernel?

how are kernels executed?
work groups, work items
hardware threads (synchronization)

choosing the right work group size

\subsection{Structure of an OpenCL program}

with pseudocode example
