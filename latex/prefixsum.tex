\section{Parallel prefix sum}

\subsection{Problem}
linear problem, hard to implement in parallel

\subsection{CPU Implementation}
code
runtime (diagram)

\subsection{Naive GPU implementation}
extremely bad performance, why?

\subsection{Optimized GPU implementation}
tree based approach (GPU Gems) work efficiency?
maybe kernel code with explanation
runtime (diagram), memory transfer vs. calculation

\subsection{Existing implementations}
Apple
libCL
(AMD APP SDK Samples)
NVIDIA OpenCL Samples
common diagram

\subsection{Conclusion}
Why linear problems are still required on GPUs? (as building block for other algorithms)
commmon diagram
