\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Motivation}
Moore's law


why is this goal important?
what could be improved? (how far?)
how could one make use of this? (which companies, domains, areas of application, all?)

\subsection{Goal}
The goal of this thesis is to provide the reader with a state of the art comparison of modern GPU and CPU performance in solving traditional problems such as sorting arrays and multiplying matrices using various algorithms.




what does this document show?
GPGPU acceleration with OpenCL
what is OpenCL? what is GPGPU computing?
example implementations of matrix multiplication, prefix sum and sorting alg.

what is the outcome of my work? (which algorithms profit from GPGPU acc, acceleration vs. invested time)


how do I get to this outcome? (chosen algorithms, used implementations, reference implementations, benchmarks)
